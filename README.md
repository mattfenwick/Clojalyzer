[The Clojalyzer](http://mattfenwick.github.io/Clojalyzer/)
==============

**The Clojalyzer** grabs Clojure files from Github projects, parses the
files to extract documentation strings, and presents these in a friendly 
format.

Try me out [online](http://mattfenwick.github.io/Clojalyzer/)!

You can also run it locally right from the git repo (you will need a working
internet connection to grab data from Github):

    $ git clone https://github.com/mattfenwick/Clojalyzer.git
    $ firefox index.html
